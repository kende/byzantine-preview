    <h4 class="section-subtitle">Space Quest</h4>
    <p class="answer">Byzantineâ€™s Space Quest is a one of a kind tokenized collectible art project that will fund real infrastructure on EARTH! Our focus is in PUERTO RICO, BROOKLYN and then BEYOND!  This is one of the largest digital art undertakings with detailed art included on each of the 10,000 tiles making up the Space Quest Multiverse mosaic. The multiverse is made up of planets, constellations, galaxies, rockets, space stations, and surprises ðŸ˜‰ The more tiles you buy the more likely your tiles will encompass a whole multiverse element. Each token contains metadata on the objects it includes and where it lies in the multiverse. We canâ€™t wait to explore the multiverse with you ðŸ’– </p>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">The Mission</h4>
    <p class="answer">Our community of innovators, artists and blockchain junkies need hyperspeed internet (@ least 100mbps!) and physical places to collaborate.  We will be simultaneously funding sustainable energy infrastructure and decentralized mesh networks providing free internet in places that need it! SO . . . weâ€™re on a mission to decentralize all the resources humans need through community spaces and mesh networking.</p>
    <h4 class="section-subtitle">How can you get involved?</h4>
    <p class="answer">We have built a new kind of decentralized mosaic art piece. We are inviting our supporters, friends, and digital art enthusiasts to buy a token (or a few) which will go toward funding these community spaces and networks!  When each tile in the mosaic is bought then the tiles will flip to reveal the Space Quest MULTIVERSE! ðŸš€ </p>
    <p class="answer">This is just our first mission. Are you in for the ride?</p>
